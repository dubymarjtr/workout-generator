## Overview

- [Netlify Page](https://workout-generator-app.netlify.app/)
- My experience building this website was really exciting. Being able to combine the knowledge that I previously had building web pages, and now getting to make them interactive and dynamic is pretty fascinating.
- I learned how to approach different application's features, and how to make them work correctly. My knowledge of JavaScript has improved building this website, since I got to implement many things I have learnt in my class, and much more, since I had to google many stuff as soon as the were popping up in my project.
- For anybody wanting to build a dynamic website: you do not need to know all the information or be an expert in this language to achieve something like this. You learn while you code, so if you think you will not be able to know how everything is going to work at the beginning, I can tell you, you will know at the end.
